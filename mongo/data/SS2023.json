As a main motivation we show that the update direction in function space resulting from the energy natural gradient corresponds to the Newton direction modulo an orthogonal projection onto the model's tangent space. We present numerical results illustrating that energy natural gradient descent yields highly accurate solutions with errors several orders of magnitude smaller than what is obtained when training PINNs with standard optimizers like gradient descent, Adam or BFGS, even when those are allowed significantly more computation time."

They  gave a description of  order preserving algebra isomorphism  between  the algebras  of   classical pseudodifferential operators of two manifolds. The subject of this talk is the generalisation of their results to manifolds with boundary. The role of the algebra of pseudodifferential operators that we are interested in is the  Boutet de Monvel algebra.\\n\\nThe main fact of life about manifold with boundary is that vector fields do not define global flows and the \"boundary conditions\" are a way of dealing with this problem. The Boutet de Monvel algebra corresponds to the choice of local boundary conditions and is, effectively,  a non-commutative completion of the manifold. One can think of  it as a parametrised version of the classical Toeplitz algebra as a completion of the half-space.\\n\\nWhat appears in the study of automorphisms are Fourier integral operators and we will try to explain their appearance - both in boundaryless and boundary case. as it turns out, the non-trivial boundary case introduces both some complications but also some simplifications of the analysis involved, Once this is done, the analysis that we need reduces to a high degree to relatively classical results about automorphisms and homology of the Toeplitz algebra and some basic facts from K-theory.\\n\\nThis is a joint work in progress with Elmar Schrohe."

It is connected with some easier to compute invariants: the module of differential forms, the conormal module, and Koszul homology can all be seen as syzygies inside the cotangent complex. Quillen conjectured that, for maps of finite flat dimension, the cotangent complex can only be bounded for locally complete intersection homomorphisms. This was proven by Avramov in 1999. I will explain how to get a new proof by paying attention to these syzygies, and how to simultaneously prove a conjecture of Vasconcelos on the conormal module."

In recent years, a new perspective on scattering amplitudes, known as amplituhedron programme, has revealed a fascinating link to various mathematical structures of a combinatorial nature, such as positive Grassmannians and cluster algebras. In this talk I will explain this connection from the point of view of derived and cluster categories of type A quivers, from which the formulae for scattering amplitudes can be obtained from projectives of hearts of intermediate t-structures. This talk is based on arXiv:2101.02884 joint with K. Ray and on arXiv:2112.14288 joint with P. Oak, A. Pal, K. Ray and H. Treffinger."

We examine its performance in simulation studies and include some theoretical backing by proving optimal convergence rates in certain settings for a modification of the algorithm. A generalized version of the algorithm is included, which can be used in classification settings. Furthermore, we prove optimal convergence rates in a classification setting using neural networks.

Here a positive lower bound of the scalar curvature is quantitatively related to the distance from the support of the differential of f and the boundary of $X$. \\n\\nA second situation consists in estimating the distance between the boundary components of Riemannian “bands” $M×[−1,1]$ where $M$ is a closed manifold that does not carry positive scalar curvature. Both situations originated from questions asked by Gromov. \\n\\nIn the final part, I will compare the Dirac method with the minimal hypersurface method and show that if $N$ is a closed manifold such that the cylinder $N \\btimes \\bmathbb{R}$ carries a complete metric of positive scalar curvature, then $N$ also carries a metric of positive scalar curvature.

One of the advantages of the approach considered here is that it is not necessary to introduce additional concepts, such as the plastic strain. Moreover, as a consequence of the thermodynamically consistent derivation, one is able to compute the evolution of the temperature field without additional complication. I will also showcase an application of this modelling approach to the Mullins effect, for which up to date there had been no simple yet fully coupled thermo-mechanical model."

A company may want to find which web page A or B generates the most interaction with its clients. Clinical trials try to determine which drug quantity has the best efficiency-toxicity trade-off.\\n\\nIn the sequential testing framework, an agent repeatedly selects one of the actions and observes a random outcome. The agent wants to find the action with the best mean outcome as quickly as possible and with high certainty. A simple strategy is to try each action in turn until enough information is gathered.

The extension to high order multistep methods requires some effort; the main difficulty concerns suitable choices of test functions. We\\ndiscuss the energy technique for all six backward difference formula (BDF) methods. In the\\ncases of the A-stable one- and two-step BDF methods, the application is trivial. The energy\\ntechnique is applicable also to the three-, four- and five-step BDF methods via Nevanlinna–\\nOdeh multipliers. The main new results are: i) No Nevanlinna–Odeh multipliers exist for the\\nsix-step BDF method. ii) The energy technique is applicable under a relaxed condition on\\nthe multipliers. iii) We present multipliers that make the energy technique applicable also to\\nthe six-step BDF method. Besides its simplicity, the energy technique for BDF methods is\\npowerful, it leads to several stability estimates, and flexible, it can be easily combined with\\nother stability techniques."

        "Zusammenf": "Movement is the primary means of an organism interacting with its environment. To study neural processes underlying movement, neuroscientists often pursue the reductionist approach of reducing the variability of the task to a few controllable factors. Controlled but ethologically artificial paradigms delineate animal behavior into individual variables. Strongly limiting the animal's behavior via head-fixation reduces the number of uncontrolled variables in the design. However, it also limits our ability to understand the naturalistic dynamics of movement. Recent studies indicate that signals related to motion are spread throughout the whole brain, even in head-restrained animals. Spontaneous movements outside the task content influence the ongoing neural activity. These findings highlight the enormous contribution of behavior to neural activity and indicate that our interpretation of ongoing processes might be confounded. Thus, there is a drive in neuroscience to study neural processes in more naturalistic environments and freely moving conditions. Measuring animal behavior in such situations is not straightforward. Furthermore, many scientific tools for electrophysiology and optogenetic modulation were initially developed for acute experiments and need to be adopted for chronic, freely moving use. In this work, we developed multiple complementary tools to help study neural processes in freely moving animals. We designed and characterized different multifunctional techniques for combining electrophysiology and optogenetics. A fluidic probe could deliver viral vectors to the recording site; a multifiber approach enabled ultra-precise 3D interrogation of neural circuits. To measure unconstrained movements, we developed FreiPose, a versatile framework to capture 3D motion during freely moving behavior, and combined the movement tracking of rats with electrophysiology. Using a modeling strategy, we described the ongoing neural activity as a combination of simultaneous multiplexed coding of multiple body postures and paw movement parameters. A virtual head-fixation approach was devised of those models to distinguish paw movements from general movement information. Using encoding models of neural activity, we clamped body and head movements to obtain the impact of the paw movements on neuronal activity. Consequently, a large fraction of neurons in the motor cortex was uncovered to be tuned to paw trajectories. This tuning was previously masked by the influence of the varying body posture information. We conclude that measuring the movements of freely moving animals is an essential step toward understanding the underlying neural dynamics. Adding precise descriptions of ongoing behavior into computational models of neural activity will enable us to describe motifs of neural population activity related to sensorimotor integration and decision-making."

        "Zusammenf": "Generalized Hoeffding-Fréchet functionals aiming at describing the possible influence of dependence on functionals of a statistical experiment, where the marginal distributions are fixed, have a long history. The problem of mass transportation can be seen as a particular case of this problem with two marginals and a linear functional induced by a distance. In the first part we give a review of some basic developments of this topic. We also describe several results for the solution for nonlinear functionals in the context of the analysis of worst case risk distributions. We show that these problems can be reduced to a variational problem and the solution of a finite class of (linear) masstransportation problems. \\n\\nIn the second part we review several approaches to improve risk bounds for aggregated portfolios of risks based on marginal information only. This endevour is motivated by the fact that the dependence uncertainty on the aggregated risks based on marginal information only is typically too wide to be acceptable in applications. Several methods have been developed in recent years to include structural and partial dependence information in order to reduce the model uncertainty. These include higher order marginals (method of reduced bounds), global variance or higher order moment bounds, partial positive or negative dependence restrictions and structural information given by common risk factors (partially specified risk factor models) or given by models with subgroup structures. Also an effective two-sided variant of the method of improved standard bounds has been developed.\\n\\nThe third part is devoted to some recent more detailed ordering results w.r.t. dependence orderings of relevant risk models making essential use of structural properties (like subgroup structure, graph structure or factor models) and on dependence properties of the models. The dependence structure of these models is given by *-products of copulas. Comparison results for *-products then allow to derive (sharp) risk bounds invarious subclasses of risk models induced by additional restrictions.\\n\\nSeveral applications show that these improved risk bounds may lead to results acceptable in praxis."

The prediction error exhibits a U-shaped behaviour. The (first) descent is due to decreasing bias, the ascent due to increasing variance. In modern machine learning, often the number of parameters by far exceeds the number of training data points. Intuitively, one could expect that the prediction error explodes with increasing model complexity due to overfitting. Belkin et al. (2019) observed that this is not the case. Instead, the prediction error decreases again when surpassing a certain threshold in model complexity, in some case even below the minimum of the classical, U-shaped regime. A phenomenon the authors denominated as double descent. To understand double descent, we study the simplest setting of linear regression and show that it can be explained by investigating the singular values of the design matrix. Finally, we give an outlook for the non-linear model setting.\\n\\nBelkin, M.; Hsu, D.; Ma, S.; Mandal, S.: Reconciling modern machine-learning practice and the classical bias–variance trade-off.

        "Zusammenf": "We investigate the optimal regulation of energy production reflecting the long-term goals of the Paris climate agreement.\\n\\nWe analyze the optimal regulatory incentives to foster the development of non-emissive electricity generation when the demand for power is served either by a monopoly or by two competing agents. The regulator wishes to encourage green investments to limit carbon emissions, while simultaneously reducing intermittency of the total energy production. We find that the regulation of a competitive market is more efficient than the one of the monopoly as measured with the certainty equivalent of the Principal’s value function. This higher efficiency is achieved thanks to a higher degree of freedom of the incentive mechanisms which involves cross-subsidies between firms. A numerical study quantifies the impact of the designed second-best contract in both market structures compared to the business-as-usual scenario. In addition, we expand the monopolistic and competitive setup to a more general class of tractable Principal-Multi-Agent incentives problems when both the drift and the volatility of a multi-dimensional diffusion process can be controlled by the Agents. We follow the resolution methodology of Cvitanić et al. (2018) in an extended linear quadratic setting with exponential utilities and a multi-dimensional state process of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type. We provide closed-form expression of the second-best contracts. In particular, we show that they are in rebate form involving time-dependent prices of each state variable."

Das Hauptergebnis hat Anwendungen auf die Konstruktion von Orientierungsdaten in der Donaldson-Thomas Theorie."

        "Zusammenf": "Solving computational homogenization problems on fine grids leads to systems of linear equations with millions to billions of unknowns, which favour iterative solvers over direct solvers.\\nHowever, the number of iterations of iterative solvers can grow with increasing system size. To\\novercome this issue, the so-called FFT-based solvers use the discrete Green’s operator preconditioning, which makes the condition number of the resulting linear system independent of the\\nsystem/grid size [1, 2]. We studied the discrete Green’s operator preconditioning from a linear\\nalgebra viewpoint and showed that all individual eigenvalues of such preconditioned systems can\\nbe bounded purely from the knowledge of the material data of the problems, both original and\\nreference. We developed a simple algorithm to compute these bounds [3, 4]. In my talk, I will\\ndiscuss the theoretical aspects of these results and practical applications of the discrete Green’s\\noperator preconditioning to periodic homogenisation problems discretised on regular grids [5].\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] Moulinec, H. and Suquet, P., A fast numerical method for computing the linear and nonlinear\\nmechanical properties of composites, Comptes Rendus de l’Acad´emie des sciences.

The bulk energy is of Dirichlet type, albeit of very general form, allowing the dependence from the unknown variable u and the position x. We employ the regularity theory of Λ-minimizers to study the regularity of the free interface. Mild assumptions concerning the dependence of the coefficients on x and u are made and are of Hölder type."
